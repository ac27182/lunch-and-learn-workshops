### notes

- `domain specific language:` an approach to modularize a functional application,a DSL is a sset of functions which address a particular concern

- `high level DSL:` expression business processes

- `low level DSL:`accessing databases, connecting to remote api's

- in functional programming DSL's are often called `algebras`.

- a dsl defines the `capabilities` of a software module, without providing a concrete implementation

- an `interpreter` is an implementation of a dsl

- a monad is a design pattern that allows structuring programs generically while automating away boilerplate code needed by the program logic

- informally a monad is anyhting with a constructor and a flatmap

- `a monad is a mechanism for sequencing computations`
